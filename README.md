# EasyReg
School registration program: applies a text-based user interface with error handling. The user can add and delete people (teachers and students) and course objects, or register a student for a course. The program uses searching and sorting algorithms on arrays of people and courses, and uses file input / output to save class details. It can display current registration status, calculate weekly profit, and substitute teachers for a course. All common input errors and event conflicts are tested and handled.
The program demonstrates the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming by implementing abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
