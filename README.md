# EasyReg

### Description

This is a mock school registration software. It applies a text-based user interface with error handling. 

The user can add and delete people (teachers and students) and course objects, or register students for courses. The program uses searching and sorting algorithms on arrays of people and courses, and uses file input / output to save class details. It can display current registration status, calculate weekly profit, and substitute teachers for a course. 

All errors and event conflicts were handled via regression and unit testing.

The program demonstrates the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming by implementing abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
